# Project-Zookeeper

While doing this project, I have learned a lot of theory on CS and some basics of Kotlin: 
"if" statements; "while" loops; "repeat"; string templates.
Main challenges were going for optional problems, i would often get stuck, sometimes use hints or just sit in front of an IDE for hours trying different combinations. 
It is frustrating when you cant get it, but very rewarding when you finally get it right.

This code, when run, lets you type in numbers from 0 to 5 and outputs different animal habitat basen on number.
Program crashes if you input any number except from 0 to 5.
Program restarts if you input any string except "exit".
String "exit" displays "See You later!" message, but program continues and upon inputing next Int in 0..5 displays animal habitat again.
